# odin-recipes

Hello! This is my first real project that I've published to GitHub.
It's a recipe website that has some recipes linked to it. It's 
pretty bland and basic as of now, but I will be coming back to 
implement interactive elements in it, as well as make the recipes 
themselves more of my own than just a simple copy of someone else's. 
Here I will be demonstrating my knowledge that I've acuqired so far
through doing the Odin Project. I will be demonstrating the use of 
HTML boilerplates, as well as various elements, tags, and links.
This is just showing the very basic use of these items, as I have
not had experience with more advanced concepts as of now.
